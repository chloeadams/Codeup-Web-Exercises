/* An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. 
Write a JS program that generates a random number between 50 and 100 representing the amount of cones to sell. 
Your code should generate numbers between 1 and 5, simulating the amount of cones being bought by her clients. 
Use a do-while loop to log to the console the amount of cones sold to each person. This is how you get the random numbers.

 // This is how you get a random number between 50 and 100
 var allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
 // This is how you get a random number between 1 and 5
 var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
The output should be similar to the following:

 5 cones sold...  // if there are enough cones
 Cannot sell you 6 cones I only have 3...  // If there are not enough cones
 Yay! I sold them all! // If there are no more cones*/
 var allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
 var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
