When I’m not working on the blog, you can find me either curled up in bed with my phone on “do not disturb” or getting lit on some dance floor. I also run a meet-up group for girl bosses, entrepreneurs, and creatives in the San Antonio, TX area called, Girl Power Hour- San Antonio.  I love working on my Instagram aesthetic, black coffee, and watching movies that were made 40+ years before I was born. My life revolves around good margaritas (and maybe a little whiskey every once in awhile), my friends & family, and collecting passport stamps.

I am a fairly recent graduate of The University of Texas at San Antonio where I received my BBA in Marketing with a concentration in Event Management. There, I discovered I had a knack for social media management and design, cultivated my passion for developing and inspiring other young women, and rediscovered my love for writing. 

In order to become a well-rounded marketer, I am currently enrolled in Codeup's Career Accelerator program for Full-Stack Web Development. When I graduate from the program in late September, my goal is to pursue a career in full-service design, web, and social media management for small to mid-size companies.
