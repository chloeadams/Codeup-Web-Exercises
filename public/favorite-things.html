<!-- // My Favorite Things
//
// We are going to build a simple list of your favorite things and display these in the form of a table in HTML.
//
// Create a new file named my-favorite-things.php and put it in your public directory.
// Create an array of your favorite things. This array should contain at least five things.
// We will need to loop through this array and display each element inside your HTML.
// Use an HTML table for this display.
// Use CSS to add a light gray background on every other row for a nice effect.
// Have fun and make it beautiful! -->
